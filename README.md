# Credit-Card-Validation
A program written in 68HC12 Microcontroller Assembly Language to verify validity of credit cards using the Luhn algorithm

Description

Crazy Haleyâ€™s Pizza currently employs a manual process to validate credit cards, which are unique to their brand and only four digits in length. This program aims to replace the manual pencil-and-paper calculations with an automated system to improve efficiency and accuracy.
